# Cayley Documentation

Good documentation have four flavors: tutorials, how-tos, discussions, and references.
In this repo I'll try to capture whatever I feel Cayley is lacking and hopefuly some of it will be part of Cayley's offical docs.

## Tutorials
TBD

## How-to guides
1. [How to insert data into Cayley using BoltDB](how-to-guides/01-insert/README.md)
1. [How to visualize your data](how-to-guides/02-visualize/README.md)
1. [How to insert opening hours of a clinic](how-to-guides/03-insert-hours/README.md)

## Notes

This documentation structure was inspired by [this article](https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/).

#### A tutorial:
* is learning-oriented
* allows the newcomer to get started
* is a lesson

Analogy: teaching a small child how to cook


#### A how-to guide:
* is goal-oriented
* shows how to solve a specific problem
* is a series of steps

Analogy: a recipe in a cookery book

#### A discussion:
* is understanding-oriented
* explains
* provides background and context

Analogy: an article on culinary social history

#### A reference guide:
* is information-oriented
* describes the machinery
* is accurate and complete

Analogy: a reference encyclopaedia article
